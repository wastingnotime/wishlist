# Repository Guidelines

This repository is the public WNT wishlist.

## Repository Role

- Own proposed ideas, requests, and their discussion for Wasting No Time.
- Treat entries as proposals until an owning repository accepts them.
- Keep shared WNT guidance in user-space capabilities and the WNT MCP surface.
- Keep durable repository decisions in Markdown.
- Expose stable contracts before implementation details.

## Non-Responsibilities

- Do not treat wishlist entries as product commitments or implementation contracts.
- Keep product decisions and implementation in their owning repositories.
- Do not copy WNT toolkit policy into this repository.
- Do not treat `wnt-tools` as this repository's source of truth.
- Do not depend on repository-local WNT installs.
- Do not make shared WNT guidance the responsibility of this repository.

## Scope Boundaries

- Root `AGENTS.md` defines this repository's identity and visitor guidance.
- `README.md` explains the public entry point.
- GitHub issues may hold individual wishlist proposals and discussion.
- This repository exports no implementation contracts.
- `work/` may hold active change artifacts if the repository uses them.
- Any WNT shared behavior should remain discoverable from user-space, not copied here.

## Visitor Guidance

- Read `README.md` before adding or acting on a proposal.
- Check the owning repository before treating a proposal as accepted work.
- Use WNT coordination workflows for changes that span repositories.

## Working Rules

- Use `wnt capability show mcp-usage` when you need MCP guidance.
- Use `wnt capability show project-surfaces` when you need project-surface defaults.
- Use conventional commit prefixes for committed changes.
- Keep repository-specific rules local to this repo.

## Repository Binding

- This repository was created with `wnt create-repository`.
- WNT shared guidance lives outside the repository and is discovered from user-space.

## WNT Repository Defaults

Shared WNT guidance lives in user-space capabilities and the WNT MCP surface.

- Use `wnt capability show mcp-usage` for MCP guidance.
- Use `wnt capability show project-surfaces` for project-surface defaults.
- Use `wnt create-repository <name>` when creating a new repository.
- Keep WNT toolkit policy out of the repository-local source of truth.

## WNT Toolkit Hints

Shared WNT knowledge is not repository truth. Resolve current WNT guidance from
user or container space through WNT capabilities or the WNT MCP surface.

```bash
wnt capability list
wnt capability show <capability-name>
```

Start with these capabilities when the task is about WNT repository behavior:

```bash
wnt capability show ai-assisted-repository-baseline
wnt capability show project-surfaces
wnt capability show change-discipline
wnt capability show cross-repo-findings
wnt capability show issue-pr-linking
wnt capability show release-delivery-validation
```

This hint block is additive discovery guidance. It is not repository identity;
root strategic docs and the rest of `AGENTS.md` remain owned by the consuming
repository.
